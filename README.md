This project is a C++ OpenGL/GLUT-based graphical simulation that visually represents a student's education journey — from school to university. It aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing way to understand the progression of a student's academic life through animations and graphics.

 ###Project Overview

The simulation showcases different stages of a student's life, including:

School Life: Depicting classrooms, study materials, and extracurricular activities.

College Life: Showing more advanced education, social interactions, and projects.

University Life: Highlighting professional growth, research, and academic achievements.

The project uses OpenGL for rendering graphics and GLUT for handling windowing, input, and animation.

 
 ###Features

Interactive visualization of educational stages

Smooth transitions between school, college, and university scenes

Animations representing students' activities (studying, moving, interacting)

Customizable environment elements (classroom, campus, books, etc.)

Realistic and engaging graphical representation using OpenGL primitives


###Technologies Used

C++ – Core programming language for logic and control

OpenGL – Graphics library for rendering 2D/3D objects

GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) – For window management, input handling, and animation.

###How to Run:
You need a compiler or IDE to compile C++ code
Opne the main.cbp file  to run the program.
